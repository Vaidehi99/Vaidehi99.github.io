We show that extraction attacks recover \"deleted\" knowledge between 18 and 38% of the time! Our attack-and-defense framework includes whitebox+blackbox attacks, and our defense objectives bring down attacks from 38%-2.4%. Our findings suggest that truly deleting sensitive information is a tractable but difficult problem. This result has potentially severe implications for deployment of LLMs in a world where individuals enjoy ownership of their data, a right to privacy, and safety from harmful model outputs.","tags":[],"title":"Can Sensitive Information Be Deleted From LLMs?
